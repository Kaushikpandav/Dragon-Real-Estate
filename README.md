Dragon Real Estate - Price Predictor 🏡📈

The dataset used in this project is derived from the well-known Housing Data. 

Originally compiled from the StatLib library at Carnegie Mellon University, this dataset has been a cornerstone for academic research and machine learning applications.

📑 All Attributes:

CRIM: per capita crime rate by town
ZN: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
INDUS: proportion of non-retail business acres per town
CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)

DIS: weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways

MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's

Note :

Remember, the MEDV attribute represents the median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's times.

Model Accuracy:

After rigorous testing and cross-validation, our model, primarily based on the Random Forest Regressor, achieves impressive accuracy in predicting housing prices. The root mean squared error (RMSE) on our test data consistently validates our model’s reliability and robustness.
